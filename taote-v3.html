The tao that can be told<BR>
is not the eternal Tao<BR>
The name that can be named<BR>
is not the eternal Name.<BR>
<BR>
The unnamable is the eternally real.<BR>
Naming is the origin<BR>
of all particular things.<BR>
<BR>
Free from desire, you realize the mystery.<BR>
Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.<BR>
<BR>
Yet mystery and manifestations<BR>
arise from the same source.<BR>
This source is called darkness.<BR>
<BR>
Darkness within darkness.<BR>
The gateway to all understanding.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="2"></A>
<H2><B>2</B></H2>
When people see some things as beautiful,<BR>
other things become ugly.<BR>
When people see some things as good,<BR>
other things become bad.<BR>
<BR>
Being and non-being create each other.<BR>
Difficult and easy support each other.<BR>
Long and short define each other.<BR>
High and low depend on each other.<BR>
Before and after follow each other.<BR>
<BR>
Therefore the Master<BR>
acts without doing anything<BR>
and teaches without saying anything.<BR>
Things arise and she lets them come;<BR>
things disappear and she lets them go.<BR>
She has but doesn't possess,<BR>
acts but doesn't expect.<BR>
When her work is done, she forgets it.<BR>
That is why it lasts forever.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="3"></A>
<H2><B>3</B></H2>
If you overesteem great men,<BR>
people become powerless.<BR>
If you overvalue possessions,<BR>
people begin to steal.<BR>
<BR>
The Master leads<BR>
by emptying people's minds<BR>
and filling their cores,<BR>
by weakening their ambition<BR>
and toughening their resolve.<BR>
He helps people lose everything<BR>
they know, everything they desire,<BR>
and creates confusion<BR>
in those who think that they know.<BR>
<BR>
Practice not-doing,<BR>
and everything will fall into place.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="4"></A>
<H2><B>4</B></H2>
The Tao is like a well:<BR>
used but never used up.<BR>
It is like the eternal void:<BR>
filled with infinite possibilities.<BR>
<BR>
It is hidden but always present.<BR>
I don't know who gave birth to it.<BR>
It is older than God.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="5"></A>
<H2><B>5</B></H2>
The Tao doesn't take sides;<BR>
it gives birth to both good and evil.<BR>
The Master doesn't take sides;<BR>
she welcomes both saints and sinners.<BR>
<BR>
The Tao is like a bellows:<BR>
it is empty yet infinitely capable.<BR>
The more you use it, the more it produces;<BR>
the more you talk of it, the less you understand.<BR>
<BR>
Hold on to the center.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="6"></A>
<H2><B>6</B></H2>
The Tao is called the Great Mother:<BR>
empty yet inexhaustible,<BR>
it gives birth to infinite worlds.<BR>
<BR>
It is always present within you.<BR>
You can use it any way you want.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="7"></A>
<H2><B>7</B></H2>
The Tao is infinite, eternal.<BR>
Why is it eternal?<BR>
It was never born;<BR>
thus it can never die.<BR>
Why is it infinite?<BR>
It has no desires for itself;<BR>
thus it is present for all beings.<BR>
<BR>
The Master stays behind;<BR>
that is why she is ahead.<BR>
She is detached from all things;<BR>
that is why she is one with them.<BR>
Because she has let go of herself,<BR>
she is perfectly fulfilled.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="8"></A>
<H2><B>8</B></H2>
The supreme good is like water,<BR>
which nourishes all things without trying to.<BR>
It is content with the low places that people disdain.<BR>
Thus it is like the Tao.<BR>
<BR>
In dwelling, live close to the ground.<BR>
In thinking, keep to the simple.<BR>
In conflict, be fair and generous.<BR>
In governing, don't try to control.<BR>
In work, do what you enjoy.<BR>
In family life, be completely present.<BR>
<BR>
When you are content to be simply yourself<BR>
and don't compare or compete,<BR>
everybody will respect you.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="9"></A>
<H2><B>9</B></H2>
Fill your bowl to the brim<BR>
and it will spill.<BR>
Keep sharpening your knife<BR>
and it will blunt.<BR>
Chase after money and security<BR>
and your heart will never unclench.<BR>
Care about people's approval<BR>
and you will be their prisoner.<BR>
<BR>
Do your work, then step back.<BR>
The only path to serenity.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="10"></A>
<H2><B>10</B></H2>
Can you coax your mind from its wandering<BR>
and keep to the original oneness?<BR>
Can you let your body become<BR>
supple as a newborn child's?<BR>
Can you cleanse your inner vision<BR>
until you see nothing but the light?<BR>
Can you love people and lead them<BR>
without imposing your will?<BR>
Can you deal with the most vital matters<BR>
by letting events take their course?<BR>
Can you step back from you own mind<BR>
and thus understand all things?<BR>
<BR>
Giving birth and nourishing,<BR>
having without possessing,<BR>
acting with no expectations,<BR>
leading and not trying to control:<BR>
this is the supreme virtue.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="11"></A>
<H2><B>11</B></H2>
We join spokes together in a wheel,<BR>
but it is the center hole<BR>
that makes the wagon move.<BR>
<BR>
We shape clay into a pot,<BR>
but it is the emptiness inside<BR>
that holds whatever we want.<BR>
<BR>
We hammer wood for a house,<BR>
but it is the inner space<BR>
that makes it livable.<BR>
<BR>
We work with being,<BR>
but non-being is what we use.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="12"></A>
<H2><B>12</B></H2>
Colors blind the eye.<BR>
Sounds deafen the ear.<BR>
Flavors numb the taste.<BR>
Thoughts weaken the mind.<BR>
Desires wither the heart.<BR>
<BR>
The Master observes the world<BR>
but trusts his inner vision.<BR>
He allows things to come and go.<BR>
His heart is open as the sky.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="13"></A>
<H2><B>13</B></H2>
Success is as dangerous as failure.<BR>
Hope is as hollow as fear.<BR>
<BR>
What does it mean that success is a dangerous as failure?<BR>
Whether you go up the ladder or down it,<BR>
you position is shaky.<BR>
When you stand with your two feet on the ground,<BR>
you will always keep your balance.<BR>
<BR>
What does it mean that hope is as hollow as fear?<BR>
Hope and fear are both phantoms<BR>
that arise from thinking of the self.<BR>
When we don't see the self as self,<BR>
what do we have to fear?<BR>
<BR>
See the world as your self.<BR>
Have faith in the way things are.<BR>
Love the world as your self;<BR>
then you can care for all things.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="14"></A>
<H2><B>14</B></H2>
Look, and it can't be seen.<BR>
Listen, and it can't be heard.<BR>
Reach, and it can't be grasped.<BR>
<BR>
Above, it isn't bright.<BR>
Below, it isn't dark.<BR>
Seamless, unnamable,<BR>
it returns to the realm of nothing.<BR>
Form that includes all forms,<BR>
image without an image,<BR>
subtle, beyond all conception.<BR>
<BR>
Approach it and there is no beginning;<BR>
follow it and there is no end.<BR>
You can't know it, but you can be it,<BR>
at ease in your own life.<BR>
Just realize where you come from:<BR>
this is the essence of wisdom.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="15"></A>
<H2><B>15</B></H2>
The ancient Masters were profound and subtle.<BR>
Their wisdom was unfathomable.<BR>
There is no way to describe it;<BR>
all we can describe is their appearance.<BR>
<BR>
They were careful<BR>
as someone crossing an iced-over stream.<BR>
Alert as a warrior in enemy territory.<BR>
Courteous as a guest.<BR>
Fluid as melting ice.<BR>
Shapable as a block of wood.<BR>
Receptive as a valley.<BR>
Clear as a glass of water.<BR>
<BR>
Do you have the patience to wait<BR>
till your mud settles and the water is clear?<BR>
Can you remain unmoving<BR>
till the right action arises by itself?<BR>
<BR>
The Master doesn't seek fulfillment.<BR>
Not seeking, not expecting,<BR>
she is present, and can welcome all things.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="16"></A>
<H2><B>16</B></H2>
Empty your mind of all thoughts.<BR>
Let your heart be at peace.<BR>
Watch the turmoil of beings,<BR>
but contemplate their return.<BR>
<BR>
Each separate being in the universe<BR>
returns to the common source.<BR>
Returning to the source is serenity.<BR>
<BR>
If you don't realize the source,<BR>
you stumble in confusion and sorrow.<BR>
When you realize where you come from,<BR>
you naturally become tolerant,<BR>
disinterested, amused,<BR>
kindhearted as a grandmother,<BR>
dignified as a king.<BR>
Immersed in the wonder of the Tao,<BR>
you can deal with whatever life brings you,<BR>
and when death comes, you are ready.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="17"></A>
<H2><B>17</B></H2>
When the Master governs, the people<BR>
are hardly aware that he exists.<BR>
Next best is a leader who is loved.<BR>
Next, one who is feared.<BR>
The worst is one who is despised.<BR>
<BR>
If you don't trust the people,<BR>
you make them untrustworthy.<BR>
<BR>
The Master doesn't talk, he acts.<BR>
When his work is done,<BR>
the people say, "Amazing:<BR>
we did it, all by ourselves!"<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="18"></A>
<H2><B>18</B></H2>
When the great Tao is forgotten,<BR>
goodness and piety appear.<BR>
When the body's intelligence declines,<BR>
cleverness and knowledge step forth.<BR>
When there is no peace in the family,<BR>
filial piety begins.<BR>
When the country falls into chaos,<BR>
patriotism is born.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="19"></A>
<H2><B>19</B></H2>
Throw away holiness and wisdom,<BR>
and people will be a hundred times happier.<BR>
Throw away morality and justice,<BR>
and people will do the right thing.<BR>
Throw away industry and profit,<BR>
and there won't be any thieves.<BR>
<BR>
If these three aren't enough,<BR>
just stay at the center of the circle<BR>
and let all things take their course.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="20"></A>
<H2><B>20</B></H2>
Stop thinking, and end your problems.<BR>
What difference between yes and no?<BR>
What difference between success and failure?<BR>
Must you value what others value,<BR>
avoid what others avoid?<BR>
How ridiculous!<BR>
<BR>
Other people are excited,<BR>
as though they were at a parade.<BR>
I alone don't care,<BR>
I alone am expressionless,<BR>
like an infant before it can smile.<BR>
<BR>
Other people have what they need;<BR>
I alone possess nothing.<BR>
I alone drift about,<BR>
like someone without a home.<BR>
I am like an idiot, my mind is so empty.<BR>
<BR>
Other people are bright;<BR>
I alone am dark.<BR>
Other people are sharper;<BR>
I alone am dull.<BR>
Other people have a purpose;<BR>
I alone don't know.<BR>
I drift like a wave on the ocean,<BR>
I blow as aimless as the wind.<BR>
<BR>
I am different from ordinary people.<BR>
I drink from the Great Mother's breasts.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="21"></A>
<H2><B>21</B></H2>
The Master keeps her mind<BR>
always at one with the Tao;<BR>
that is what gives her her radiance.<BR>
<BR>
The Tao is ungraspable.<BR>
How can her mind be at one with it?<BR>
Because she doesn't cling to ideas.<BR>
<BR>
The Tao is dark and unfathomable.<BR>
How can it make her radiant?<BR>
Because she lets it.<BR>
<BR>
Since before time and space were,<BR>
the Tao is.<BR>
It is beyond <I>is</I> and <I>is not</I>.<BR>
How do I know this is true?<BR>
I look inside myself and see.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="22"></A>
<H2><B>22</B></H2>
If you want to become whole,<BR>
let yourself be partial.<BR>
If you want to become straight,<BR>
let yourself be crooked.<BR>
If you want to become full,<BR>
let yourself be empty.<BR>
If you want to be reborn,<BR>
let yourself die.<BR>
If you want to be given everything,<BR>
give everything up.<BR>
<BR>
The Master, by residing in the Tao,<BR>
sets an example for all beings.<BR>
Because he doesn't display himself,<BR>
people can see his light.<BR>
Because he has nothing to prove,<BR>
people can trust his words.<BR>
Because he doesn't know who he is,<BR>
people recognize themselves in him.<BR>
Because he has no goad in mind,<BR>
everything he does succeeds.<BR>
<BR>
When the ancient Masters said,<BR>
"If you want to be given everything,<BR>
give everything up,"<BR>
they weren't using empty phrases.<BR>
Only in being lived by the Tao
can you be truly yourself.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="23"></A>
<H2><B>23</B></H2>
Express yourself completely,<BR>
then keep quiet.<BR>
Be like the forces of nature:<BR>
when it blows, there is only wind;<BR>
when it rains, there is only rain;<BR>
when the clouds pass, the sun shines through.<BR>
<BR>
If you open yourself to the Tao,<BR>
you are at one with the Tao<BR>
and you can embody it completely.<BR>
If you open yourself to insight,<BR>
you are at one with insight<BR>
and you can use it completely.<BR>
If you open yourself to loss,<BR>
you are at one with loss<BR>
and you can accept it completely.<BR>
<BR>
Open yourself to the Tao,<BR>
then trust your natural responses;<BR>
and everything will fall into place.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="24"></A>
<H2><B>24</B></H2>
He who stands on tiptoe<BR>
doesn't stand form.<BR>
He who rushes ahead<BR>
doesn't go far.<BR>
He who tries to shine<BR>
dims his own light.<BR>
He who defines himself<BR>
can't know who he really is.<BR>
He who has power over others<BR>
can't empower himself.<BR>
He who clings to his work<BR>
will create nothing that endures.<BR>
<BR>
If you want to accord with the Tao,<BR>
just do your job, then let go.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="25"></A>
<H2><B>25</B></H2>
There was something formless and perfect<BR>
before the universe was born.<BR>
It is serene. Empty.<BR>
Solitary. Unchanging.<BR>
Infinite. Eternally present.<BR>
It is the mother of the universe.<BR>
For lack of a better name,<BR>
I call it the Tao.<BR>
<BR>
It flows through all things,<BR>
inside and outside, and returns<BR>
to the origin of all things.<BR>
<BR>
The Tao is great.<BR>
The universe is great.<BR>
Earth is great.<BR>
Man is great.<BR>
These are the four great powers.<BR>
<BR>
Man follows the earth.<BR>
Earth follows the universe.<BR>
The universe follows the Tao.<BR>
The Tao follows only itself.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="26"></A>
<H2><B>26</B></H2>
The heavy is the root of the light.<BR>
The unmoved is the source of all movement.<BR>
<BR>
Thus the Master travels all day<BR>
without leaving home.<BR>
However splendid the views,<BR>
she stays serenely in herself.<BR>
<BR>
Why should the lord of the country<BR>
flit about like a fool?<BR>
If you let yourself be blown to and fro,<BR>
you lose touch with your root.<BR>
If you let restlessness move you,<BR>
you lose touch with who you are.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="27"></A>
<H2><B>27</B></H2>
A good traveler has no fixed plans<BR>
and is not intent upon arriving.<BR>
A good artist lets his intuition<BR>
lead him wherever it wants.<BR>
A good scientist has freed himself of concepts<BR>
and keeps his mind open to what is.<BR>
<BR>
Thus the Master is available to all people<BR>
and doesn't reject anyone.<BR>
He is ready to use all situations<BR>
and doesn't waste anything.<BR>
This is called embodying the light.<BR>
<BR>
What is a good man but a bad man's teacher?<BR>
What is a bad man but a good man's job?<BR>
If you don't understand this, you will get lost,<BR>
however intelligent you are.<BR>
It is the great secret.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="28"></A>
<H2><B>28</B></H2>
Know the male,<BR>
yet keep to the female:<BR>
receive the world in your arms.<BR>
If you receive the world,<BR>
the Tao will never leave you<BR>
and you will be like a little child.<BR>
<BR>
Know the white,<BR>
yet keep to the black:<BR>
be a pattern for the world.<BR>
If you are a pattern for the world,<BR>
the Tao will be strong inside you<BR>
and there will be nothing you can't do.<BR>
<BR>
Know the personal,<BR>
yet keep to the impersonal:<BR>
accept the world as it is.<BR>
If you accept the world,<BR>
the Tao will be luminous inside you<BR>
and you will return to your primal self.<BR>
<BR>
The world is formed from the void,<BR>
like utensils from a block of wood.<BR>
The Master knows the utensils,<BR>
yet keeps to the the block:<BR>
thus she can use all things.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="29"></A>
<H2><B>29</B></H2>
Do you want to improve the world?<BR>
I don't think it can be done.<BR>
<BR>
The world is sacred.<BR>
It can't be improved.<BR>
If you tamper with it, you'll ruin it.<BR>
If you treat it like an object, you'll lose it.<BR>
<BR>
There is a time for being ahead,<BR>
a time for being behind;<BR>
a time for being in motion,<BR>
a time for being at rest;<BR>
a time for being vigorous,<BR>
a time for being exhausted;<BR>
a time for being safe,<BR>
a time for being in danger.<BR>
<BR>
The Master sees things as they are,<BR>
without trying to control them.<BR>
She lets them go their own way,<BR>
and resides at the center of the circle.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="30"></A>
<H2><B>30</B></H2>
Whoever relies on the Tao in governing men<BR>
doesn't try to force issues<BR>
or defeat enemies by force of arms.<BR>
For every force there is a counterforce.<BR>
Violence, even well intentioned,<BR>
always rebounds upon oneself.<BR>
<BR>
The Master does his job<BR>
and then stops.<BR>
He understands that the universe<BR>
is forever out of control,<BR>
and that trying to dominate events<BR>
goes against the current of the Tao.<BR>
Because he believes in himself,<BR>
he doesn't try to convince others.<BR>
Because he is content with himself,<BR>
he doesn't need others' approval.<BR>
Because he accepts himself,<BR>
the whole world accepts him.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="31"></A>
<H2><B>31</B></H2>
Weapons are the tools of violence;<BR>
all decent men detest them.<BR>
<BR>
Weapons are the tools of fear;<BR>
a decent man will avoid them<BR>
except in the direst necessity<BR>
and, if compelled, will use them<BR>
only with the utmost restraint.<BR>
Peace is his highest value.<BR>
If the peace has been shattered,<BR>
how can he be content?<BR>
His enemies are not demons,<BR>
but human beings like himself.<BR>
He doesn't wish them personal harm.<BR>
Nor does he rejoice in victory.<BR>
How could he rejoice in victory<BR>
and delight in the slaughter of men?<BR>
<BR>
He enters a battle gravely,<BR>
with sorrow and with great compassion,<BR>
as if he were attending a funeral.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="32"></A>
<H2><B>32</B></H2>
The Tao can't be perceived.<BR>
Smaller than an electron,<BR>
it contains uncountable galaxies.<BR>
<BR>
If powerful men and women<BR>
could remain centered in the Tao,<BR>
all things would be in harmony.<BR>
The world would become a paradise.<BR>
All people would be at peace,<BR>
and the law would be written in their hearts.<BR>
<BR>
When you have names and forms,<BR>
know that they are provisional.<BR>
When you have institutions,<BR>
know where their functions should end.<BR>
Knowing when to stop,<BR>
you can avoid any danger.<BR>
<BR>
All things end in the Tao<BR>
as rivers flow into the sea.<BR>
<HR>
<A NAME="33"></A>

The great Tao flows everywhere.<BR>
All things are born from it,<BR>
yet it doesn't create them.<BR>
It pours itself into its work,<BR>
yet it makes no claim.<BR>
It nourishes infinite worlds,<BR>
yet it doesn't hold on to them.<BR>
Since it is merged with all things<BR>
and hidden in their hearts,<BR>
it can be called humble.<BR>
Since all things vanish into it<BR>
and it alone endures,<BR>
it can be called great.<BR>
It isn't aware of its greatness;<BR>
thus it is truly great.<BR>

She who is centered in the Tao<BR>

She perceives the universal harmony,<BR>
even amid great pain,<BR>
because she has found peace in her heart.<BR>

Music or the smell of good cooking<BR>
may make people stop and enjoy.<BR>
But words that point to the Tao<BR>
seem monotonous and without flavor.<BR>

When you listen for it, there is nothing to hear.<BR>

If you want to shrink something,<BR>
you must first allow it to expand.<BR>
If you want to get rid of something,<BR>

If you want to take something,<BR>

The Tao never does anything,<BR>
yet through it all things are done.<BR>

If powerful men and women<BR>
could venter themselves in it,<BR>
the whole world would be transformed<BR>
by itself, in its natural rhythms.<BR>

The Master doesn't try to be powerful;<BR>
thus he is truly powerful.<BR>
The ordinary man keeps reaching for power;<BR>
thus he never has enough.<BR>
<BR>
The Master does nothing,<BR>
yet he leaves nothing undone.<BR>
The ordinary man is always doing things,<BR>
yet many more are left to be done.<BR>

The kind man does something,<BR>
yet something remains undone.<BR>
The just man does something,<BR>
and leaves many things to be done.<BR>
The moral man does something,<BR>
and when no one responds<BR>
he rolls up his sleeves and uses force.<BR>
<BR>
When the Tao is lost, there is goodness.<BR>
When goodness is lost, there is morality.<BR>
When morality is lost, there is ritual.<BR>
Ritual is the husk of true faith,<BR>
the beginning of chaos.<BR>
<BR>
Therefore the Master concerns himself<BR>
with the depths and not the surface,<BR>
with the fruit and not the flower.<BR>
He has no will of his own.<BR>
He dwells in reality,<BR>
and lets all illusions go.<BR>

When man interferes with the Tao,<BR>
the sky becomes filthy,<BR>
the earth becomes depleted,<BR>
the equilibrium crumbles,<BR>
creatures become extinct.<BR>

The Master views the parts with compassion,<BR>
because he understands the whole.<BR>
His constant practice is humility.<BR>

I let go of economics,<BR>

When he makes a mistake, he realizes it.<BR>
Having realized it, he admits it.<BR>
Having admitted it, he corrects it.<BR>
He considers those who point out his faults<BR>
as his most benevolent teachers.<BR>
He thinks of his enemy<BR>
as the shadow that he himself casts.<BR>

The hard and stiff will be broken.<BR>
The soft and supple will prevail.<BR>

As it acts in the world, the Tao<BR>
is like the bending of a bow.<BR>
The top is bent downward;<BR>
the bottom is bent up.<BR>
It adjusts excess and deficiency<BR>
so that there is perfect balance.<BR>
It takes from what is too much<BR>
and give to what isn't enough.<BR>
<BR>
Those who try to control,<BR>
who use force to protect their power,<BR>
go against the direction of the Tao.<BR>
They take from those who don't have enough<BR>
and give to those who have far too much.<BR>
<BR>
The Master can keep giving<BR>
because there is no end to her wealth.<BR>
She acts without expectation,<BR>
succeeds without taking credit,<BR>
and doesn't think that she is better<BR>
than anyone else.<BR>

Nothing in the world<BR>
is as soft and yielding as water.<BR>
Yet for dissolving the hard and inflexible,<BR>
nothing can surpass it.<BR>
<BR>
The soft overcomes the hard;<BR>
the gentle overcomes the rigid.<BR>
Everyone knows this is true,<BR>
but few can put it into practice.<BR>
<BR>
Therefore the Master remains<BR>
serene in the midst of sorrow.<BR>
Evil cannot enter his heart.<BR>
Because he has given up helping,<BR>
he is people's greatest help.<BR>
<BR>
True words seem paradoxical.<BR>

<A NAME="79"></A>

Failure is an opportunity.<BR>
If you blame someone else,<BR>
there is no end to the blame.<BR>
<BR>
Therefore the Master<BR>
fulfills her own obligations<BR>
and corrects her own mistakes.<BR>
She does what she needs to do<BR>
and demands nothing of others.<BR>

If a country is governed wisely,<BR>
its inhabitants will be content.<BR>
They enjoy the labor of their hands<BR>
and don't waste time inventing<BR>
labor-saving machines.<BR>
Since they dearly love their homes,<BR>
they aren't interested in travel.<BR>
There may be a few wagons and boats,<BR>
but these don't go anywhere.<BR>
There may be an arsenal of weapons,<BR>
but nobody ever uses them.<BR>
People enjoy their food,<BR>
take pleasure in being with their families,<BR>
spend weekends working in their gardens,<BR>
delight in the doings of the neighborhood.<BR>
And even though the next country is so close<BR>
that people can hear its roosters crowing and its dogs barking,<BR>
they are content to die of old age<BR>
without ever having gone to see it.<BR>

True words aren't eloquent;<BR>
eloquent words aren't true.<BR>
Wise men don't need to prove their point;<BR>
men who need to prove their point aren't wise.<BR>
<BR>
The Master has no possessions.<BR>
The more he does for others,<BR>
the happier he is.<BR>
The more he gives to others,<BR>
the wealthier he is.<BR>
<BR>
The Tao nourishes by not forcing.<BR>
By not dominating, the Master leads.<BR>
